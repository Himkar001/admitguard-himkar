Introduce soft eligibility rules that allow exceptions with justification.

Soft rules:
- Age must be between 18 and 35.
- Graduation year must be between 2015 and 2025.
- Percentage must be at least 60%.
- CGPA must be at least 6.0.
- Screening test score must be at least 40.

Behavior:
- Soft rule violations should not block submission by default.
- Instead, show an exception toggle when violated.
- Track the number of soft rule exceptions applied per candidate.

Do not allow exceptions for strict rules.
