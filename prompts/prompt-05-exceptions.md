Add structured exception handling for soft rule overrides.

Requirements:
- Each exception must require a rationale input.
- Rationale must have a minimum length and include professional justification keywords.
- Display an exception count indicator per candidate.
- If exception count exceeds the allowed limit, flag the entry for manager review.

Outcome:
Exceptions are governed decisions, not informal overrides.
