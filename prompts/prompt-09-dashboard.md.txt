## Prompt 09 — Audit Dashboard

Enhance the Audit Log view by adding a read-only operational dashboard.

Context:
AdmitGuard already stores eligibility evaluations in an audit log.
Operations and managers need high-level visibility into outcomes and exception usage.

Task:
Add a summary dashboard at the top of the Audit Log page.

Dashboard Metrics:
- Total evaluations
- Eligible candidates
- Eligible with exceptions
- Blocked / rejected candidates
- Manager review required count
- Exception usage rate (percentage)

Rules:
- All metrics must be derived dynamically from existing audit log records.
- No new data storage or backend services.
- Dashboard must update automatically when audit data changes.
- Clearing the audit log must reset dashboard values.

UI Requirements:
- Display metrics as compact statistic cards.
- Use subtle color cues (green, amber, red).
- No charts or interactive filtering.

Outcome:
Provide operational visibility without modifying eligibility logic or audit data.
