You are building a lightweight, professional eligibility validation application for an admission operations team.

Context:
Candidate data is currently entered in Excel without validation, leading to ineligible candidates reaching late stages of the admission process.

Task:
Build a single-page web application with a clean, professional UI that allows form-based entry of candidate data.

Requirements:
- Include fields for personal, academic, and process-related information.
- Use clear labels, helper text, and structured layout.
- No backend server; client-side only.
- Focus on clarity and operational usability rather than visual gimmicks.

Outcome:
A structured eligibility form suitable for early-stage admission screening.
