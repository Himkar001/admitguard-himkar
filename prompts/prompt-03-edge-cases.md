Refine validation logic to correctly handle edge cases.

Requirements:
- Prevent numeric characters in name fields.
- Ensure phone number validation rejects alphabetic characters.
- Ensure email uniqueness is enforced within the session.
- Block submission consistently when strict rules fail.

Do not modify the overall UI structure.
Focus only on validation correctness and edge-case handling.
