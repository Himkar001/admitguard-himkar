Polish the application UI and UX.

Requirements:
- Improve spacing, headers, and section clarity.
- Use a professional color palette suitable for enterprise tools.
- Add clear eligibility status indicators (Eligible, Exception Required, Blocked).
- Ensure error messages and helper text are easy to understand.

Do not add new features.
Focus only on clarity and usability.
