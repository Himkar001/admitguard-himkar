# Research Notes — Vibe Coding & Google AI Studio

## Objective
Understand how Google AI Studio’s Build / Vibe Coding mode can be used to generate lightweight applications with real-time validation logic.

## Initial Research (Wednesday Evening)
- Read official Google AI Studio documentation
- Explored examples of form-based apps built using AI Studio
- Watched introductory videos on Gemini models and structured outputs

## Key Takeaways (Early)
- AI Studio can generate full client-side applications without backend servers
- Structured prompts and configs are critical for predictable behavior
- Validation logic should be explicit and testable

(To be expanded as development progresses.)
