# AdmitGuard

AdmitGuard is a lightweight eligibility validation system that prevents ineligible candidates from progressing through advanced admission stages.

## Problem
Manual data entry and complex eligibility rules cause ineligible candidates to be identified too late in the admission pipeline, wasting operational effort and damaging candidate experience.

## Solution
AdmitGuard enforces eligibility rules at the point of data entry using real-time validation, structured exception handling, and a full audit trail.

## Constraints
- No backend server
- Config-driven eligibility rules
- Built using Google AI Studio (Vibe Coding)

This repository follows a sprint-based development approach.
